#### So now we gonna try to connect to all ports and see if they are available to connect to

      wuseman@thinkpad ~ $ telnet 203.0.113.1 82
      Trying 203.0.113.1...
      Connected to 203.0.113.1.
      Escape character is '^]'.
      GET /index.html
      Connection closed by foreign host.

      wuseman@thinkpad ~ $ telnet 203.0.113.1 8080
      Trying 203.0.113.1...
      Connected to 203.0.113.1.
      Escape character is '^]'.
      get /update.html
      GET /index.html
      Connection closed by foreign host.


     Same result on 8090 and 8091, but on 17000 we got a shell, bingo!!

      wuseman@thinkpad ~ $ telnet 203.0.113.1 17000
      Trying 203.0.113.1...
      Connected to 203.0.113.1.
      Escape character is '^]'.
